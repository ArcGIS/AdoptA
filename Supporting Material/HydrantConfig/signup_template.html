  <h1>Welcome to the Social Shoveling program, and thank you for participating!</h1>
  <p>There are 3 important guidelines</p>
	<p>1. Shovel out the hydrant - This is critical to ensure the fire department can do their job as fast as possible.</p>
	<p>2. Dig a path to the street - Not only do they need to be able to find the hydrant, they need to be able to access it.</p>
	<p>3. Monitor your email - we will send periodic weather updates and a way to update the status of your adopted hydrant.</p>
