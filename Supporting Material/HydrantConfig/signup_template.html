  <h1>Welcome to Social Shoveling Program</h1>
  <p>The Social Shoveling program makes it easy for community members to volunteer to dig out a fire hydrants in case of severe snowfall.</p>
  <p>This program allows you to claim responsibility for shoveling out fire hydrants after heavy snowfall.</p>
                <p>In the midst of winter snowstorms, buried hydrants cause dangerous delays for fire fighters. 
                But having City employees check and clear thousands of hydrants would be a timely, costly and burdensome process.</p>
                <p>The Social Shoveling lets us look to community members for help. 
                This map-based web app allows individuals, small businesses and community organizations to volunteer in shoveling out specific hydrants.</p>
